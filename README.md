## Data Analysis 

### Felicia Demulling

### Dataset Chosen:

-	The dataset I chose was the Prosper Loan dataset with a dataset containing 110,000 different loan information.

### Feedback:

-	I did not receive feedback from my peers, however, I did show my husband and he was pretty impressed with how far Iâ€™ve come since the beginning.

### Main findings & Results that were put in the explanatory analysis:

-	There were a lot of findings during this analysis. My favorite and most pronounced finding was the correlation between interest rate and credit score. It was also surprising to see that most of the borrowers had credit scores between 700 and 725. I used this in my explanatory analysis because it was the clearest graph that showed a direct correlation.
-	The next finding that I found most interesting was that computer programmers, executives, teachers and administrative assistants borrow more frequently. But the graph I created shows that judges, pharmacists, doctors and executives borrow the most amount of money. I used this in my explanatory analysis because I found it interest that some people borrowed more frequently and some borrowed less frequently, however, they borrowed much more. 
-	Also, I found that there is a direct correlation between the loan status and the credit score. People that paid their loan completely typically had an average credit score of roughly 780. People that defaulted on their loan typically had average credit scores of 650. People, who canceled their loan, had the lowest score of all the loan statuses. I used this in my explanatory analysis because I found the relationship between credit score and whether someone would pay their loan is directly correlated. 
	
#### Other findings:
-	The majority of borrowers make between 4,000 and 4,500 dollars monthly and have an interest rate between 15 and 20 percent. The majority of borrowers make between 2,500 and 5,000 dollars monthly. The heat graph I created was a little scattered and I did not find a direct correlation.
-	The most popular borrower state is California which is not surprising beings they have a high population. It is not surprising that the other states are higher. Many of the top borrowing states have high population. It would be worth looking at each state versus population.
-	The most common occupation for borrowers is "Professional". Since this is was vague, I decided to remove this term and look more into the correlation between occupation and loan amount.
-	There is not a huge correlation between monthly income and prosper score. There is quite a bit of yellow between 3,000 dollars monthly income and 5,500 dollars monthly income and the prosper score ranges from 4 to 9.
